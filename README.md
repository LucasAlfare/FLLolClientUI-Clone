# FLLolClienteUI-Clone

My own attempt in cloning the league of legends client lobby UI, using Kotlin/Jetpack Compose.

In this attempt I'm working in a simple database build directly in the kotlin code, once they should work only to populate UI components.

I don't have any interest in extending this to stabilish real connection to the Riot Servers, so the only purpose of this is to practice UI programming by cloning a very well-known interface.
